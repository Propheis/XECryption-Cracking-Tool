##XECryption Cracking Tool
This tool provides a means for decrypting text encrypted using the XECryption algorithm.
This was the tool I wrote to help me decode an encrypted email in a programming challenge.
###Using the script
- Run the script in python and call 'decryptFile("your_path_to_file")
- Follow the on screen instructions.
- The script will write a file to disk containing the possible decryptions.
- Find the valid decryption and look at the index number associated with it
- Input the index number back into the prompt in the python shell
- Your file will be decrypted and written to disk.
###Disclaimer
I wrote this script for a fun challenge, and an exercise in problem solving.
Please only use this for educational purposes. I cannot be held liable for any actions taken/caused by those who use this script.
Please use common sense and only decrypt files that belong to you! Thanks :)
